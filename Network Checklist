# Network Security Penetration Testing Checklist

## Switches:
1. **Port Security:**
   - Verify MAC address filtering and limitations on the number of MAC addresses per port.
   - Check for unauthorized access.

2. **VLAN Security:**
   - Ensure proper segmentation and isolation.
   - Test VLAN hopping vulnerabilities.

3. **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):**
   - Check for misconfigurations leading to STP-based attacks.
   - Disable unnecessary STP instances.

## Routers:
1. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
   - Review and test ACLs for proper traffic filtering.
   - Check for overly permissive rules.

2. **Routing Protocol Security:**
   - Verify security of routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP).
   - Check authentication and encryption settings.

3. **Management Access:**
   - Secure management interfaces with strong authentication (SSH, SNMPv3).
   - Disable unnecessary services.

## Firewalls:
1. **Rule Set Review:**
   - Review and validate firewall rule sets.
   - Check for overly permissive rules.

2. **Stateful Inspection:**
   - Verify effectiveness of stateful inspection.
   - Test for evasion techniques.

3. **VPN Configuration:**
   - Assess security of VPN configurations.
   - Verify encryption and authentication settings.

## Wireless LAN (WLAN) Devices:
1. **WPA/WPA2/WPA3 Security:**
   - Ensure strong encryption (WPA2 or WPA3).
   - Check for weak or default passwords.

2. **SSID Security:**
   - Disable SSID broadcasting (if not needed).
   - Verify SSIDs do not reveal sensitive information.

3. **WIDS/WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention System):**
   - Test effectiveness of WIDS/WIPS.
   - Check for rogue access points.

## Access Points (APs):
1. **Authentication and Encryption:**
   - Verify use of strong authentication and encryption protocols.
   - Check for open or insecure configurations.

2. **Physical Security:**
   - Ensure physical security of access points.
   - Test for vulnerabilities related to physical access.

3. **Firmware and Patch Management:**
   - Confirm access point firmware is up to date.
   - Check for vulnerabilities related to outdated firmware.
