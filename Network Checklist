# Blackbox Offensive Penetration Testing Checklist

## Switches:
1. **Port Discovery:**
   - Enumerate open ports and services on switches.
   - Identify potential entry points for unauthorized access.

2. **VLAN Enumeration:**
   - Attempt to discover and enumerate VLANs in use.
   - Exploit potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in VLAN implementations.

3. **STP Vulnerabilities:**
   - Probe for misconfigurations leading to STP-based attacks.
   - Attempt to disrupt network stability through STP manipulation.

## Routers:
1. **External Network Mapping:**
   - Identify and enumerate external IP ranges.
   - Probe for potential router misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

2. **Routing Protocol Assessment:**
   - Attempt to gather information on routing protocols and their configurations.
   - Exploit vulnerabilities related to routing protocol misconfigurations.

3. **External Service Enumeration:**
   - Enumerate and assess externally accessible services.
   - Identify potential weaknesses in access control lists (ACLs).

## Firewalls:
1. **Rule Set Enumeration:**
   - Attempt to enumerate firewall rule sets from an external perspective.
   - Identify overly permissive rules allowing unauthorized traffic.

2. **Firewall Evasion Techniques:**
   - Test for evasion techniques to bypass firewall filtering.
   - Assess the effectiveness of stateful inspection.

3. **VPN Exploitation:**
   - Probe VPN configurations for weaknesses.
   - Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in VPN implementations.

## Wireless LAN (WLAN) Devices:
1. **Wireless Network Discovery:**
   - Enumerate available wireless networks from an external perspective.
   - Identify open or insecure configurations.

2. **WLAN Exploitation:**
   - Attempt to exploit weaknesses in WPA/WPA2/WPA3 security.
   - Test for rogue access points and potential WIDS/WIPS bypass.

3. **SSID Enumeration:**
   - Discover and enumerate SSIDs.
   - Exploit potential information leakage from SSID names.

## Access Points (APs):
1. **External AP Enumeration:**
   - Identify and enumerate externally accessible access points.
   - Probe for vulnerabilities in AP configurations.

2. **Authentication Bypass:**
   - Attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms on access points.
   - Exploit potential vulnerabilities in authentication protocols.

3. **Firmware Vulnerability Testing:**
   - Assess access point firmware for known vulnerabilities.
   - Exploit weaknesses related to outdated firmware.
